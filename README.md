# Algorithms and Data Structures in Go

My implementation of the most common algorithms and data structures using golang as a part of my studying.

Algorithms:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Two Crystall Balls Problem Solution
- Bubble Sort
- Maze Solver
- Quick Sort
- Traversals, Pre Order, In Order, Post Order, BFS traversals
- BFS / DFS
- Binary Search Tree
- Binary Tree Comparison
- Dijkstra Shortest Path

Data Structures:
- Queue
- Stack
- Array
- Arraylist
- Ringbuffer
- Doubly Linked List
- Binary Tree
- Trie
- Heap
- Map
- LRU
